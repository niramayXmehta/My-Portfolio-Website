            <h1>About Me</h1>    
            <section>
                <p>
                    My name is Niramay Mehta, and I am currently a first-year student at Queen Mary University of London, pursuing BSc Degree in Computer Science.
                    I aim to become a professional in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and using my skills, I want to make AI more accessible to everyone around the world.
                    I am focussed and driven individual, abiding by the motto, Speak Less and Work More.
                    <br>
                    However, I am also a thrill-seeker, and love an adventure. I can gel with people easily, and work great as a part of a team, but won't be shy when asked to
                    take leadership roles.
